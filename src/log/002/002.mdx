### Today's Progress

Continued with my portfolio website. I made a mini site map, the site is not too complicated just a homepage with some links to my projects and links to anything I write. Coding wise I mostly worked on the header, but didn't get much work done

### Thoughts

Once again not much coding done. Once the site is up and running I plan on converting all the articles I write into wordpress pages and loading them to the website using the wordpress API.
**TOTAL TIME: 1 hour**
